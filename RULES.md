# Chkobba (also spelled Chkouba or Chcobba)

**Note:** This description is based on content sourced from [Wikipedia artical](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chkobba) after translation.

Chkobba (Arabic: شكبّة or škubba) is a card game derived from the Italian game Scopa, brought to Tunisia by Italian immigrants.

It is typically played with traditional cards and is most commonly played between two players or two teams of two players. However, it is also possible, though less common, to play with three or four independent players.


## Rules

The objective of Chkobba is to be the first to score a predetermined number of points. Each player plays one card at a time during each round. When no more cards are left to play, the round ends, and the points are tallied. If no player has reached the required points to win, a new round begins.

### Card Profile

The game consists of forty cards organized into four suits (Spades ♠, Hearts ♥, Diamonds ♦, and Clubs ♣), with ten cards in each suit. In Arabic, the suit of Diamonds is called Dīnārī (ديناري), derived from the Italian word *denari*. The cards are numbered from 1 to 7, and there are three face cards: the Queen, worth 8 points; the Jack, worth 9 points; and the King, worth 10 points. Numbered cards have a value equal to their number, and the Ace is always worth 1 point.

Each card value has a specific name with etymology from French, Spanish, Italian, or Arabic:

| Card | Arabic Name    | Etymology                                            |
|------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| A    | لص (Laṣ)       | From French "as" (Ace)                               |
| 2    | دو (Dū)        | Likely from Sicilian "du" (Two)                      |
| 3    | تريس (Trīs)    | Likely from Sicilian "tri" (Three) or Spanish "tres" |
| 4    | كواترو (Kwātrū) | Likely from Sicilian "quattru" (Four)                |
| 5    | شينكو (Šīnkū)   | Likely from Sicilian "cincu" (Five)                  |
| 6    | سيس (Sīs)      | Likely from Sicilian "sis" (Six)                     |
| 7    | سبعة (Sabʿa)   | "Seven" in Arabic                                    |
| Q    | مجيرة (Mujīra)  | Likely from Spanish "mujer" or Sicilian "mugghièri" (Queen) |
| J    | كوّال (Kawwāl)  | Likely from Spanish "caballo" meaning "horse" or "cavalier" |
| K    | ريّ (Rayy)      | Likely from Spanish "rey" meaning "king"            |
| 7♦   | سبعة الحيّة (Sabʿa l-ḥayya) | The 7 of Diamonds, often considered the most important card in the game, has its own name, "Sabʿa l-ḥayya" meaning "the living 7" in Arabic. |

### Card Distribution

One player shuffles the cards and presents the deck to their opponent, who cuts the deck and draws a card. The opponent can either keep the card or place it on the table (usually a simple table is used for play). Then, the first player deals according to the opponent's choice. If the opponent keeps the first card, the dealer gives them two more cards, then deals three to themselves, and finally places four cards on the table. If the opponent places the first card on the table, the dealer adds three more cards, then deals three to the opponent and three to themselves. The game thus begins with four cards on the table and three cards in each player’s hand.

If, after the initial deal, there are three cards of the same value on the table, the deal is redone to avoid having unplayable cards remain on the table from the start to the end of the game.

The first turn begins with the opponent who drew the first card. When there are no cards left in the players' hands, the dealer deals three more cards to each player, and the next round begins. There are six rounds per game.

At the end of each game, the roles of the dealer and the opponent are swapped.

### Gameplay

There are two ways to capture cards (أكل ʾakala or "eat" in Arabic):

1. **Matching**: You can capture a card of the same value as one of your own. The two cards are then kept face down in a pile.
2. **Addition**: If a player has a Queen and there is a 7 and an Ace on the table, they can take all three cards and place them face down in their pile. An addition can only be made if the player has the exact sum in hand and the terms of the addition are on the table. For example, if the player has a 7 and an Ace, they cannot play them together to capture a Queen.

If a player holds a card that allows both possibilities, the capture of the card of the same value takes priority over addition. Thus, a player cannot use a Queen to take a 7 and an Ace if there is another Queen on the table.

If you cannot "eat" a card, you place one on the table, as passing a turn is not allowed. If you have the possibility of capturing with one of the cards in your hand, it is not mandatory to play it first. You can play other cards that do not allow for a capture and save the capture for later, depending on your strategy. Finally, if there are cards left on the table at the end of the game, the last player to capture a card takes all the remaining cards on the table.

### Scoring

The goal of the game is to be the first to score a minimum of 11, 21, or 31 points, with players deciding beforehand how many points to play to. There are two types of points: the four final points, counted at the end of each game, and the Chkobba points, which can be earned during the game.

#### Four Final Points

The four final points are Kārṭa (كارطة), Dīnārī (ديناري), Barmīla (برميلة), and Sabʿa l-ḥayya (سبعة الحيّة). They are awarded to players at the end of each game according to specific rules:

- **Kārṭa**: Gives one point to the player with the most cards in their pile. If there is a tie, no one scores.
- **Dīnārī**: Gives one point to the player with the most diamonds in their pile. If there is a tie, no one scores.
- **Barmīla** (from Italian *primiera*): Gives one point to the player with the most 7s in their pile. If there is a tie, the number of 6s is counted. If there is still a tie, no one scores.
- **Sabʿa l-ḥayya**: Gives one point to the player who holds the 7 of Diamonds. Except for the Chkobba points, this card is the only one that, by itself, scores a point, giving it a psychological significance. Possessing three 7s, including the 7 of Diamonds, awards two points (Sabʿa l-ḥayya and Barmīla) to the holder.

If there is a tie for one of the points, it is declared Bājī (باجي).

#### Chkobba Points

Chkobba points are special points scored during the game according to a simple rule: each time a player captures all the cards on the table in a single move, they score one point. To remember these points during the final count, the card used to score the Chkobba is placed face up on the pile. Chkobba cannot be scored at the end of the last turn of a game.

When a Chkobba is scored, the card used to score the point is placed face up on the pile.

### Main Strategies

Chkobba is an interactive game that requires quick decision-making and involves intelligence and anticipation. Once the game starts, from a Tunisian perspective at least, there is no room for downtime. The nature of this game is to play quickly, as speed makes it more difficult to count the cards, and playing fast can unsettle a player who is counting cards.

Chkobba allows players to execute tactical moves, employing strategies that may be unique or ever-changing, which can destabilize the opponent. One common tactic is to trap the opponent by forcing them to "eat" in order to make a Chkobba. For example, if there is a 6 and a Jack on the table and the first player has a Jack and a 2, suspecting the opponent might have a Queen, they place their 2. The opponent "eats" the 6 and 2 with their Queen (which is worth eight), and the first player then makes a Chkobba with their Jack. Consequently, some players adopt a defensive strategy, consistently trying to prevent the opponent from making a Chkobba. For example, if there is a Queen on the table, they will play a 5 instead of a 2 because eight and five make thirteen, and since there are no cards worth thirteen, there is no risk of a possible Chkobba.

Another strategy is to "eat" everything the opponent places on the table, depriving them of cards
